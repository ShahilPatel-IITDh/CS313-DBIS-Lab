Edgar Frank Codd was born in Fortuneswell, Dorset, on the Isle of Portland. Codd earned his PhD from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in 1965. In the thesis, which built on von Neumann's work and demonstrated that a set of eight states was adequate for universal computing and building, he discussed self-replication in cellular automata. His self-replicating computer design was only realised in 2010. He developed his views of data organisation over the 1960s and 1970s, publishing "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks" in 1970, a year after an internal IBM document. To his dismay, IBM took a while to use his ideas, at least until business rivals started doing so.
Codd's theorem, a result established in his seminal work on the relational model, equates the expressive power of relational algebra and relational calculus.
